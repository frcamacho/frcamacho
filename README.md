### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ Nice to Meet You :purple_heart:

My name is Francine Camacho, a genomic data scientist innovating at the intersection of bioinformatics, data science, and software engineering. Python and R are my go-to languages, but I can hack together some Groovy because I am a big fan of Nextflow. With a Ph.D. in Quantitative and Computational Biology, I offer extensive experience across different stages of startups, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical ventures. Hailing from Brooklyn, I'm passionate about pickleball and an avid supporter of #44 Lewis Hamilton.
